# Extracts all Faces from the image frame using haarcascades
# Stores the Face information into numpy arrays
# 1.Read and show video stream, capture images
# 2.Detect Faces and show bounding box
# 3.Flatten the largest face image and save in a numpy array
# 4.Repeat the above for multiple people to generate training data




# Recognise Faces using some classification algorithm like Logistic,KNN,SVM etc.

# 1.load the training data (numpy arrays of all the persons)
# x- values are stored in the numpy arrays
# y-values we need to assign for each person
# 2.Read a video stream using opencv
# 3.extract faces out of it
# 4.use KNN to find the prediction of face (int)
# 5.map the predicted id to name of the user
# 6.Display the predictions on the screen - bounding box and name
